<h2 align="left">Hey, I'm Shihan!</h2>
<h4 align="left">I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. <br />I am currently looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2026.</h4>

I'm currently building GraphNote, which builds an offline knowledge graph from your documents and notes, using ML-driven embeddings for instant semantic search and interactive exploration.
I'm also building Velocore, a trading engine built in C++, connected to live market data and paper trading functionality through Alpaca API.

If you wanna learn pretty much everything about me, check out my portfolio [here](https://s-sharar.vercel.app) (I had a lot of fun building this, it's definitely worth checking out).
